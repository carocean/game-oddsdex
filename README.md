# Overview of Idea


> Simulate a coin being randomly thrown and then touch and guess its front and back. Players can buy at any time without worrying about whether the 
> current state is being thrown, touched or matched, just like the wheels rolling, and when they arrive, they will chase you. Therefore, forming a 
> queue that guesses as a positive win and a queue that guesses as a negative win, just like the five tier trading in the stock market, is simply 
> analogized by copying the loss ratio to copying the stock price, and the number of bets is analogized to the number of shares. Each bet is set to 1 
> CNY, and in the case of Ethereum, it is set to 0.001 ETH
